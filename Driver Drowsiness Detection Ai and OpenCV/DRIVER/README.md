This code implements a drowsiness detection system using facial landmarks. It utilizes the MediaPipe FaceMesh model to detect facial landmarks and calculates the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to determine if a person is drowsy. If the EAR falls below a certain threshold for a specified duration, an alarm is triggered. Additionally, it incorporates the functionality to play a custom audio notification when drowsiness is detected.

Detailed README Description:
The provided code consists of two main components: VideoFrameHandler and AudioFrameHandler, which collectively form a drowsiness detection system.

VideoFrameHandler:
Utilizes the MediaPipe FaceMesh model to detect facial landmarks.
Calculates the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) based on the position of specific landmarks for both eyes.
Monitors the EAR values over time to determine drowsiness.
If the EAR falls below a specified threshold for a predefined duration (WAIT_TIME), it triggers an alarm indicating drowsiness.
Provides visual feedback by plotting facial landmarks and textual information on the video frame.
AudioFrameHandler:
Handles the playback of custom audio notifications based on drowsiness detection.
Prepares the custom audio file and segments it into smaller chunks based on the duration of each audio frame.
Utilizes PyAV library to process audio frames and play the custom audio segments when triggered.
Provides functionality to dampen audio frames to simulate silence when no notification is required.
Usage:
Requirements: Python, OpenCV, NumPy, Mediapipe, PyAV, PyDub.
Setup: Ensure the required libraries are installed (pip install -r requirements.txt).
Configuration: Adjust the thresholds (EAR_THRESH, WAIT_TIME) in the code as needed.
Execution: Run the main script, passing the video file or camera input as an argument.
